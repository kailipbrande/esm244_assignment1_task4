      "contents": "\r\nOak Ecology and Demography: I am interested in oak populations of the foothill ecosystems in California, and how drought and climate change plays a role in their longevity and mortality rates.\r\nOak Bark Allometry and Fire Adaptive Traits: I am intrigued to find out if oaks’ bark properties can serve as a protective mechanism against fire. With fire becoming increasingly normal (again) across California foothills, I hope to discover whether the species’ evolved traits can be considered fire adaptive (as a product of historic fire regime), or if they are instead very vulnerable to mortality risk from fire.\r\nFire Behavior: In order to understand the effects of fire on oak trees, we must first understand the “typical” range of fire behavior in foothill ecosystems, specifically grasslands (which are the most common understory habitat beneath oaks). We hope to quantify fire intensity, flame height, rate of spread, maximum temperature, and other variables, and relate them to burn severity and associated mortality risk for the oaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
