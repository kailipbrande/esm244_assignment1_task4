I am a second-year PhD student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Currently, my research interests include oak ecology and demography; oak bark allometry and fire adaptive traits; and fire behavior in California foothill ecosystems. I have long been passionate about the conservation of natural places in California.
